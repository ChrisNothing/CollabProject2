---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 1 - Started 2025-04-01, Functionally Completed 2025-04-01, Improved As Needed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris: Created the GitHub repository and shared access to David and Prof. Zwolinsky. This README
       file will be used to track the work done by each group member and when it was completed.

David: Created the C++ project via "using existing code" option to link to the repository, and
       pushed this initial project to GitHub after adding some standard functions and includes.
       It seems the better process is to create the repo in Visual Studio and push from there.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 2 - Started 2025-04-03, Functionally Completed 2025-04-03, Improved As Needed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris: Followed and copied down the example radix sort function for integers while David spent the
       lecture setting up the project files within the repository.

David: Implemented a radix sort of strings by copying over the class example, modifying it using
       Microsoft Copilot, and further editing it to account for the fact that only the 26 capital
       letters are expected for this project. Formatted and commented the code as needed as well.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 3 - Started 2025-04-08, Functionally Completed 2025-04-10, Improved As Needed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chris: Developed the initial function code and test for removing duplicate words from a list of
       words and returning the truncated vector.

David: Retrofitted Chris's function and test to fit within the established project framework,
       making sure to preserve Chris's variable names and choice of coding operations. This
       function needed pretty significant changes in order to partition out the test.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 4 - Started 2025-04-09, Functionally Completed 2025-04-11, Improved As Needed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chris: Developed the initial function code and test for obtaining a vector of valid single-letter
       transformations of a word given an initial word and a list of possible words.

David: Retrofitted Chris's function and test to fit within the established project framework,
       making sure to preserve Chris's variable names and choice of coding operations. This
       function needed only minor changes, mainly to work with capitals and unordered sets.
